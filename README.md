# Task-Board

This Kanban-style board helps you visualize and manage your tasks by organizing them into columns based on their status. Each task is represented by a card that can be moved between columns, reflecting its progress. Typical columns include:

To Do: Tasks that need to be started.

In Progress: Tasks currently being worked on.

Done: Completed tasks.
